MacTwee
=======

MacTwee is a Mac OSX authoring tool for Twee stories. Is is written in Objective-C and uses the Twee terminal app to build html files. It can import and export .tw, .twee. .txt files. The goal is to make authoring Twee stories in a single application with simplicity.

Usage
=======

MacTwee can be used to author stories from scratch, but requires Twee in order to build to html. A working copy of Twee is included in this Git and upon building a project, MacTwee will ask you to point to the twee file. This version of twee only differs from the current Twee source with a small one line fix for an exporting issue.
