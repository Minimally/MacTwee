Usage
=======

MacTwee can be used to author stories from scratch, but requires Twee in order to build to html. A working copy of Twee is included in this Git and upon building a project, MacTwee will ask you to point to the Twee file. The included version of Twee only differs from the current Twee source with a small one line fix for an exporting issue.
