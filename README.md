MacTwee
=======

MacTwee is an objective-c wrapper for Twee. It uses Sprite Kit for a visual view of story maps, so 10.9 Mavericks or higher is required. It uses Core Data for managing stories across multiple projects. It includes various features for editing passages within a story.

Twee is required to compile html files, and upon building a project MacTwee will ask you where you have a copy of Twee installed locally (you can also set this in preferences). A working copy of Twee is included in this Git.
